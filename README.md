# ThemeManager
A plugin for DiscordInjections that allows you to manage themes and CSS snippets.

The plugin currently works, but the code needs some serious optimization and refactoring. I just kind of got buried by other projects and I don't have any time to work on this anymore - I'll have to pick it up at a later date. I didn't want to leave you guys hanging with absolutely nothing though, as I hyped the plugin up quite a bit. Sorry. :l

Aside from horrible code and unoptimized methods, there is one bug you should be made aware of. If you enter the [snippet creation menu](https://i.imgur.com/VvoRTyC.png), I suggest you don't hit escape and exit out of Discord's setting panel until *after* hitting Save. If you don't, the Save button will glitch when you come back and you can't save the snippet anymore. If that happens, just reload your Discord client (ctrl + r) and it'll be normal again.
